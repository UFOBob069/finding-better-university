    question: "Is it cheaper to stay in a vacation rental or Disney hotel?",
    answer: "Vacation rentals near Disney World typically offer 30-50% savings compared to Disney resort hotels. A 4-bedroom vacation home averages $200-300 per night, while similar space at Disney would require multiple rooms at $300+ each. Additional savings include:\n\n• No daily parking fees ($25-30 savings per day)\n• No resort fees\n• Save on dining with full kitchen access\n• Free amenities like private pools\n• More space for large families or groups\n\nWhile Disney hotels offer perks like Early Theme Park Entry, our properties provide significantly more space and amenities at a fraction of the cost."
